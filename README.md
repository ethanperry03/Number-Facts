# Number-Facts
 This project test various relations between numbers entered by user
You can either uniquely factor an input value, check if two values are coprimes,
or find the least common multiple between two inputted values.


Explination:
 First the test functions are run and if they all pass, a passed statment is printed. Then a greeter gets the users name and asked if they are ready. That index value entered then calls the specific function. The base functions do the task and return a specific output given by the problem and are formatted in a specific way. The test functions are derived from the original with slight modifications. Both normal and test functions read in values and perform calculations with them. For the test functions, if the expected matches the real value, a 1 is returned to be added to the sum and if the amount of test conditions equals the sum, all tests pass. This function also loops until correct inputs are entered and completely ends when a 0 is entered.
